Software Development Lifecycle

How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
User needs become user stories when you grasp what the user wants and is considered a priority. When come user wants a sorting option or things listed in a certain way
these become user stories. By creating user stories you make a list of what needs to be done and implemented into the application.

How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
When developing a program you must look at what you knmow about the program needs before you can create a solid plan. After learning as much if not all of the
information you can begin to develop user stories. The whole concept of agile is the best way to develop any software if you have the means to do so. Agile does have
its limits when it comes to cost but I feel that using the communication that its built on should be used in any development.

What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
To be a good team member you must attend daily scrum meetings and discuss everything that you have completed and plan to complete. Annoucing issues that youve come
across is also important in helping the rest of the team. Communicating with the testers and the scrum master also helps keep you focused and on task with what needs
to be completed.
